            I'm not really sure. You'll have to ask one of our fabulous directors! They specialize in directing the organization. They also organize the directions. They do it all internationally, not for profit. This kind of international non-profit directional organization requires strong leadership and dedication to the organization! They are organized directors directing the organization.

            The hardest part of creating an international non-profit organization is figuring out the logistics of organizing internationally without making profit. Thankfully, our team of directors direct the logistics of organizing on an international scale. The directors organize the directions and direct the organization, across the world, without making money. Donations will help us organize internationally!
